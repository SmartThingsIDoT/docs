## (Lack of) Multi User Support

A search on web has numerous articles and support forum cases, where people are asking for a good solution to have multiple user support with appropriate access control. Here are few links:
* [Multiple users, multiple systems, multiple devices: Is this the smart home from hell?](http://www.cnet.com/news/multiple-users-multiple-systems-multiple-devices-is-this-the-smart-home-from-hell/)
* [Mobile app authorization levels for multiple users (teenagers!)](https://community.smartthings.com/t/mobile-app-authorization-levels-for-multiple-users-teenagers/9446)
* [How Do I Add Additional Users To the App](https://community.smartthings.com/t/how-do-i-add-additional-users-to-the-app/22538)
* ... and more

Basic theme in these articles/support request is:
* how can I have multiple users access my smart home?
* how can I have access restrictions with access to my smart home?
* how can I share my smart home access without sharing ALL the passwords?
* how can I have a smart home without needing SO MANY passwords?
